AEON Bank Technical Assessment developed by Ahmad Nuzul Asrar

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install Packages

First, you will need to install packages. I'm using Yarn myself but you can use others too.

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 2: Install Pods for iOS

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### iOS Only

```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

## Step 3: Run the Mobile App

Start **Metro**

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

Then run it on iOS or Android

### iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

### Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

## Successful Running the app

If you've successfully run the app, proceed with the assessment and testing.
